## Run the development environment:
1. Run ```npm install``` in both base(backend) folder and in Frontend folder.
2. Run ```npm run server``` for running the backend server, ```npm run client``` for running local frontend server, and ```npm run build``` to craete production build for deployment. Note: You'll have to insert MongoDB URI in server.js at line number 14 for running the backend of the project.
3. Run ```npm run dev``` (recommended) for running for both server concurrently, thus running full project as it should.
